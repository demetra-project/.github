# Demetra
Demetra is a project that merges artificial intelligence and advanced technologies to protect certain areas, such as national parks and natural reserves. It focuses on detecting fires, to prevent environmental disasters, and on identifying waste using computer vision algorithms. Through real-time communication with a dashboard, the system ensures quick responses and efficient environmental monitoring.
# ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Automatic detection of **fires**, **waste**, and **human presence**
- Real-time **environmental monitoring** via **dashboard**:
  - Atmospheric gases (e.g., methane, CO‚ÇÇ)
  - **Temperature** and **humidity**
  - **Geolocation** of the drone and detected objects
- Drone manually operated via remote controller
# üöÄ Upcoming Features
- **Automatic alert system**: real-time notifications when environmental values exceed safe thresholds or a threat is detected (e.g., fire, gas buildup)
- **Human-assisted verification**: video frames sent to the dashboard to allow an operator to confirm detections
- **Offender identification**: individuals responsible for illegal dumping or arson will be recognized and reported to authorities
# üå± Strengths
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale from a single drone to an entire collaborative fleet
- **Adaptability**: Modular architecture adaptable to environmental, industrial, and civil applications
- **Onboard AI**: Local processing minimizes bandwidth needs by avoiding constant cloud communication
- **Customization**: Clients can order drones tailored to their specific use cases
